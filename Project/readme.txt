On the process of learning a new programming language, you have to memorize all the keywords and syntax of the language.
The best way to do that is by doing projects based on the newly learned language.

In this series, as my first project I will be building an event management dashboard using php and mysql.
The main aim is to get aquainted with the basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The admin will be able to add a new event, check the details of an event, edit the details of an event, delete an event.

I have already done a small of the dashboard using figma and one can view it using the link below:

So, without any further ado, let's get started.
