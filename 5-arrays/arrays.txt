A php array can be considered as a variable used to hold related data.
Php arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable.
Arrays can be created using the array() function or by using square brackets.
*they come in two types:
    1.indexed arrays
    2.associative arrays

1.indexed array:
    Indexed arrays are named so because they are ordered and accessed by their index.
    the indices start from 0 and go to n-1.
    example of an indexed array is:
        $cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");//using array() function
        or $cars=["Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota"];//using square brackets

    To access the value of an indexed array, we use the index number.
    For example, to access the value of the first element of the array, we use the index number 0,
    that is if we were to print the "Volvo" value, we would write:
        echo $cars[0];
    The second element would be accessed by the index number 1, the third element by the index number 2  and so on.
    The last element of the array would be accessed by the index number n-1.

2.associative arrays:
    Associative arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable.
    Associative arrays contains its items as key-value pairs.
    The keys are used to access the values.
    Associative arrays are accessed by the key name.
    example of an associative array is:
        $age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");//using array() function
        or $age=["Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43"];//using square brackets
    To access the value of an associative array, we use the key name.
    For example, to access the value of the key "Peter", we would write:
        echo $age["Peter"];
    The value of the key "Ben" would be accessed by the key name "Ben".
    The value of the key "Joe" would be accessed by the key name "Joe".
    The last element of the array would be accessed by the key name n-1.

There also exists a third type of array called multidimensional arrays.
Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays,that is the contents of the array can also be arrays.
For example:
    $cars = [
        ["name"=>"Volvo", "model"=>"XC90", "year"=>"2016"],
        ["name"=>"BMW", "model"=>"X5", "year"=>"2017"],
        ["name"=>"Toyota", "model"=>"Corolla", "year"=>"2018"]
    ]
They are useful when we want to store multiple values in one single variable.

some built in functions that can be used on arrays include:
    1-count()
        //counts the number of elements in an array
        //it can be used on indexed arrays and associative arrays
    2-sort()
        //sorts the elements of an array
        //it can be used on indexed arrays and associative arrays
    3-array_keys()
        //returns an array containing all the keys of an array
        //it can be used on associative arrays
    4-array_values()
