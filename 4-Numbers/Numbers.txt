The other php data type include numbers, and they come in two types: integer and float.
    Integers are used to represent whole numbers, and 
    Floats are used to represent decimal numbers.
    Example:
        $x = 5;//an integer
        $y = 5.5;//a float
Some basic operations are performed on numbers include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and many other arithmetic operations.

Others include increment and decrement operations, and the modulus operator.
Example:
    $age=20;
    $age++;//$age is now 21 or 
    $age--;//$age is now 20
    $age%=2;//$age is now 0, since the modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the two numbers.

Some built in functions that can be used with numbers include:
        floor()-rounds down a number to the nearest integer
            //eg: floor(5.5) = 5
        ceil()-rounds up a number to the nearest integer
            //eg: ceil(5.5) = 6
        round()-rounds a number to the nearest integer
            //eg: round(5.5) = 6
        abs()-returns the absolute value of a number
            //eg: abs(-5) = 5
        pow()-returns the power of a number
            //eg: pow(2,3) = 8
        sqrt()-returns the square root of a number
            //eg: sqrt(9) = 3
        max()-returns the highest value of a list of numbers
            //eg: max(1,2,3,4,5) = 5
        min()-returns the lowest value of a list of numbers
            //eg: min(1,2,3,4,5) = 1
        rand()-returns a random number
            //eg: rand() = a random number between 0 and 1
and many others that one can easily find on google.
