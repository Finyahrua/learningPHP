relearnig php from scratch
My first encounter with php was not a smooth one and I hated the language almost instantly.

Although it has a large programmers community I still could not understand the language.
However, with my current understanding of the other programming languages I decided to re learn this language and documenting my process so that someone else who struggles with this language can understand it.

Within each folder  that contains source code there is also a txt file that contains the description of the particular topic under concern.

If there is anything missing from the parts that I have already covered, please feel free to contribute to it after informing me. 

Thank you for reading.
