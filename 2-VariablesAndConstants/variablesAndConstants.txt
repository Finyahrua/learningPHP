variables are used to store data or information.
this information can be used in the future on other parts of the program,eg having a variable to store the name of the user and then using that variable to display the name of the user.

In php, variables are declared with the $ sign.
php variables are case sensitive and must start with a letter or an underscore.
Its common to use camelCase for naming variables.

Example of a variable:
    $name = "John";
    $email = "johndoe@gmail.com"
When using normal variable names in php, The variables can be overridden in later part of the program although this is not a very good idea.
However, when trying to overide constansts, you will encounter errors saying that the variable has already been defined.

In php, constansts are declared with the define() function.
constants are case sensitive and must start with a letter or an underscore, its a convection to use uppercase letters for constants.
Example:
    define("USERNAME", "John");
    define("EMAIL", "johndoe@gmail.com");
